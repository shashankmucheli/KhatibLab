			<h6><span style="font-size: medium; "><strong><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Design of New Protein Functions </span></strong></span></h6>
			<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Several years ago, we developed a general computational strategy for designing new protein structures that incorporates full backbone flexibility into rotamer-based sequence optimization. This was accomplished by integrating ab initio protein structure prediction, atomic-level energy refinement, and sequence design in Rosetta. The procedure was used to design Top7, a 93-residue protein with a novel sequence and topology. Top7 was found to be folded and highly stable, and the x-ray crystal structure of Top7 is virtually identical &nbsp;to the design model (Kuhlman et al, 2003).</span><br /><span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;">Since the validation of our protein design methodology provided by Top7, we have focused on designing proteins with new and useful functions. We are concentrating on four challenges: (1) the design of new protein-protein interactions, (2) the design of new enzymes catalyzing reactions not catalyzed by naturally occurring enzymes, (3) the design of novel endonucleases with any specified cleavage specificity, and (4) the design of a vaccine for HIV.</span><br /><span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;">Design of Novel Enzymes</span><br /><span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;"></span></p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;">We have been developing general methodology for designing enzyme catalysts for any arbitrary chemical reaction.&nbsp; Given a reaction for which a catalyst is desired, the first step of the approach is to compute the structures of the intermediates and transition states along the reaction pathway.&nbsp; The second step is to design, using a combination of quantum mechanical calculations and general chemical principles, a number of ideal disembodied active sites consisting of protein functional groups (hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, positive and negative charges, aromatic rings, etc.) positioned around the superimposed ensemble of reaction intermediates and transition states in a manner optimal for catalysis.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each such disembodied active site model is essentially a hypothesis about how to catalyze the reaction—for each reaction we need to experiment with multiple such hypotheses as there is no guarantee that any one will be a good catalyst.&nbsp; The third step is to design proteins which fold to structures with pockets containing the disembodied active sites.&nbsp; Again, for each active site hypothesis, we generally produce multiple design as we cannot be sure that any one protein design will fold so as to perfectly realize the desired active site. </span><br /><span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;"></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We are taking two approaches to the third (protein design) step.&nbsp; The first approach is to design from scratch a protein which folds up to produce the desired active site. We have been developing the methodology for this approach by building up a library of “platonic ideal” versions of the most common protein folds; thus far we have designed and experimentally validated hyperstable ferrodoxin and Rossman folds with different number of secondary structural elements—we are now working to incorporate catalytic site architecture into this de novo design process.</span><br /><span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;"></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The second approach is to search through already existing protein scaffolds containing binding pockets for sets of backbone positions with geometries compatible with the ideal active site.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this purpose we have developed a program called RosettaMatch which uses geometric hashing to identify compatible active site placements (Zanghellini et al, 2006); we generally search a set of 200 hyperthermophilic protein scaffolds from which the sidechains have been stripped.&nbsp; Following the geometric matching step, we use standard Rosetta protein design to optimize the residues surrounding the binding pocket to maximize the binding affinity for the reaction transition state.&nbsp; The results described in the following paragraphs were obtained with this approach.</span><br /><span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;"></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Given the uncertainties in each step in the design process, we compute and test many designed proteins for each reaction we are pursuing.&nbsp; Fortunately, advances in gene synthesis technology have brought both the cost and synthesis times for production of synthetic genes way down in the last few years.&nbsp; As designed sequences emerge from the computer, we translate the amino acid sequences back to DNA sequences and order synthetic genes in E Coli T7 expression vectors; once the designed genes are shipped back we can easily express and purify the his-tagged designed proteins using affinity chromatography, and then assay enzymatic activity.</span><br /><span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;"></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have used the approach described above to design enzymes that catalyze four quite different chemical reactions using a diverse set of catalytic mechanisms (Figure 1). The designed Kemp elimination catalysts (Fig 1, top left) use classical general acid-base catalysis in which a protein is abstracted from a substrate carbon atom using either a histidine or carboxylate containing sidechain (Roethlisberger et al, 2008).&nbsp; The designed retroaldolase catalysts (Fig 1, top right) utilize a catalytic lysine residue that forms a Schiff base with a ketone group on the substrate, and then serves as an electron sink to promote bond breakage (Jiang et al, 2008).&nbsp; Two bound waters are positioned by hydrogen bonding groups in the design to promote proton shuttling.&nbsp; The bimolecular diels alder catalysts (Fig 1, bottom right) have extended binding sites to bind both substrates, and hydrogen bond donors and acceptors to increase the overlap between the HOMO of one substrate and the LUMO of the other.&nbsp; Finally, the designed esterase catalyst (Fig 1, bottom left) uses a his-cys dyad for nucleophilic attack on the substrate carbonyl group, and an oxyanion hole made up of one backbone atom and two sidechains to stabilize the negative charge in the transition state.</span><br /><span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;"></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have designed active enzymes for each of the four reactions; an important step forward for design and enzymology.&nbsp; Catalytic residue knockouts eliminate the catalytic activity, suggesting that the observed activities are due to the designed sites.&nbsp;&nbsp; Crystal structures have validated the structure of the designed catalysts for all but the esterase design.</span><br /><span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;"></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This success in de novo catalyst design is very encouraging and an important&nbsp; step forward for both the protein design and enzymology fields.&nbsp; However, there is still huge room for improvement.&nbsp; First and foremost, the activities of the designed enzymes are &nbsp;low by comparison with native enzymes.&nbsp; Fortunately, we have been able to collaborate with the research groups of Danny Tawfik (Weizmann) and Don Hilvert (ETH, Zurich) who are expert in directed evolution.&nbsp; In collaboration with their groups, we have been able to increase the activities of the initial computational designs considerably, and equally important, learn what amino acid changes the design calculations missed-a critical part of the process of improving the methodology (Roethlisberger et al, 2008; Kheronsky et al, in press).&nbsp; The most active of the evolved computationally designed catalysts now has a kcat/Km of 5x105/M sec&nbsp; and a rate enhancement over the background reaction of&nbsp; over 108 ; these values approach those of naturally occurring enzymes.</span><br /><span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;"></span></p>
